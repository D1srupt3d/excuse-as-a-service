thanks for wanting to add more excuses!

## adding excuses

1. fork the repo
2. edit `excuses.json`
3. add your excuse to the array
4. make a pull request

### excuse guidelines

- keep it casual and funny
- no punctuation at the end
- lowercase preferred
- can be short or long
- try to be original
- all types welcome (work, life, tech, whatever)

### good examples

```json
"my cat knocked over my coffee"
"still debugging production oops"
"got lost in a wikipedia rabbit hole"
"the vibes are off today"
```

### bad examples

```json
"I have a prior engagement." (too formal)
"MY DOG ATE MY HOMEWORK" (all caps)
"this is a really really really really long excuse that goes on forever and nobody wants to read" (too long)
```

## guidelines

- one to many exuses per pr
- check for duplicates first
- keep it funny but not offensive (maybe)
- spelling mistakes are fine if theyre funny
